    <li>
        <span class="bold_title">Definitions.</span>
        <ol class="innerlist">
            <li>"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, encyclopedia, essay, or
            presentation in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
            contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a
            collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work
            (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.</li>
            <li>"Derivative Work" means a work based on the Work, or on the Work and other pre-existing works, such as
            a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, sound recording, art reproduction,
            abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
            except that a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
            For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
            synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
            Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.</li>
            <li>"Educational Purpose(s)" means (i) for the primary purpose of learning or teaching in both formal
            and informal educational settings, (ii) use by educators or students in classrooms, libraries, schools,
            and at home, and/or (iii) the presentation of materials to an individual or a group for the purpose of
            learning or teaching.</li>
            <li>"Licensor" means the WGBH Educational Foundation and Public Broadcasting Service.</li>
            <li>"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work as set forth in the attribution
            file which accompanies the downloaded Work.</li>
            <li>"Term" means the period commencing on the date You initially download the Work and ending upon the
            expiration date (the "Expiration date") set forth in the attribution file which accompanies the
            downloaded Work, unless earlier terminated by Licensor pursuant to Section 7(a) below or extended pursuant
            to Section 8(b).</li>
            <li>"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.</li>
            <li>"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously
            violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from
            the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold_title">Fair Use Rights.</span>
        <p>Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first
        sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
        applicable laws.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold_title">License Grant.</span>
        <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, free,
        non-exclusive license to exercise the rights in the Work during the Term solely for Educational Purposes
        as stated below:</p>
        <ol class="innerlist">
            <li>to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce
            the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;</li>
            <li>to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, or perform publicly(including by means of a
            digital audio transmission) the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The
        above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
        rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not
        expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold_title">Restrictions.</span>
        <p>The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
        restrictions:</p>
        <ol class="innerlist">
            <li>You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform (digitally or otherwise) the Work only under
            the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier ("URI")
            for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly
            perform (digitally or otherwise). You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or
            restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
            not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
            of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform (digitally or otherwise)
            the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent
            with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
            Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
            terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from Licensor You must, to the extent
            practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.</li>
            <li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is for
            or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for
            other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be for
            or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment
            of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.</li>
            <li>If you distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform (digitally or otherwise) the Work, You must
            keep intact all copyright notices for the Work or Collective Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
            or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author as supplied in the download file, and/or
            (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
            publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice or download file, terms of
            service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
            supplied; and to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
            Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
            notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
            provided, however, that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum, such credit will appear where
            any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
            comparable authorship credit.</li>
            <li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above for any purpose other than a
            non-commercial Educational Purpose.</li>
            <li>You may not create Derivative Works.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold_title">Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.</span>
        <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
        REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR
        OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
        ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO
        SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold_title">Limitation on Liability.</span>
        <p>EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL
        THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE
        OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold_title">Termination.</span>
        <ol class="innerlist">
            <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of
            the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from You under
            this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated, provided such individuals or entities
            remain in full compliance with this license. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination
            of this License.</li>
            <li>Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
            the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
            (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
            this License will continue in full force and effect until the Expiration Date unless earlier terminated
            as stated above.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold_title">Miscellaneous.</span>
        <ol class="innerlist">
            <li>Each time You distribute or publicly perform (digitally or otherwise) the Work or a Collective Work,
            the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
            license granted to You under this License.</li>
            <li>Licensor may, in its sole discretion, extend the Expiration Date for the Work. You are encouraged to
            check back to the Web site for any such changes to the Expiration Date(s).</li>
            <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
            the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
            by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
            make such provision valid and enforceable.</li>
            <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such
            waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
            consent.</li>
            <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed
            here. There are no understandings, agreements, or representations with respect to the Work not specified
            here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
            You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</li>
